                <p>Usually, web development online courses for kids teach them how to use HTML (the Hypertext Markup
                    Language)
                    and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Unlike web builders, creating a website with HTML and CSS requires
                    real
                    coding skills.

                    These two are the core technologies for building web pages.

                    HTML – defines the structure of the page
                    CSS – specifies the layout of the elements on the web page
                    By using HTML and CSS, kids are able to build simple and complex web interfaces. Children can see
                    the
                    results of any changes made to the code, which helps them better understand how everything works –
                    how
                    changes to HTML impact the layout of web pages and how CSS changes create different visual effects.
